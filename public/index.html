  <h1>Elle Held</h1>
  <p class="kicker"><strong>Systems Engineer / IT Consultant</strong></p>
        <p class="lede">I'm Elle Held, an IT professional with a decade of experience in IT and 7 years in the MSP space. Originally from Wisconsin, I moved to Austin, Texas after graduating with a Bachelor’s of Business Administration in Information Technology from the University of Wisconsin - Whitewater.</p>
        <p>I’ve spent the last 7 years at an MSP here in Austin, where I learned the IT needs for all types of businesses and supported every type of end user. In addition, I served as systems administrator and primary point for escalations for all clients.</p>
        <p>Since 2021, I’ve worked as a systems engineer developing diagrams and project plans for large systems migrations, and seeing the projects through as a project manager. I love looking at the big picture and finding practical, innovative improvements to new and existing systems wherever necessary.</p>
        <p>I combine a business sense with deep systems knowledge to deliver clear visions that lead to reliable outcomes.</p>
