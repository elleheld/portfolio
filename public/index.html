  <h1>Elle Held</h1>
  <p class="kicker"><strong>Systems Engineer / IT Consultant</strong></p>
        <p class="lede">I'm Elle Held, an IT professional with a decade of experience in IT and 7 years in the MSP space. Originally from Wisconsin, I moved to Austin, Texas after graduating with a Bachelor’s of Business Administration in Information Technology from the University of Wisconsin - Whitewater.</p>
        <p>I’ve spent the last 7 years at an MSP here in Austin, where I learned the ropes and gained a detailed understanding of how every type of business runs. In addition, I acted as the systems administrator and primary point for escalations.</p>
        <p>Since 2021, I’ve acted as a systems engineer responsible for developing the diagrams and project plans for large systems migrations, and acting as the project manager. I have a passion for seeing the big picture and finding areas for improvement. I pride myself in being able to find the right systems solutions for any scenario.</p>
        <p>I now combine my business background with my systems knowledge to focus on IT consulting. </p>
