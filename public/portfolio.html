      <h2>Project One — Complex Existing Server Optimization</h2>

      <p><span class="lbl lbl-problem">Problem</span>
        This customer had a previous MSP that was unable to deliver on a server upgrade project and this company had server infrastructure that was in disarray. 2012 servers in use.
      </p>

      <p><span class="lbl lbl-solution">Solution</span>
        Rebuild the entire server infrastructure and failover cluster from scratch ensuring zero downtime and full use of existing storage and hardware. Decommission 2012 servers and virtualize their workloads.
      </p>

      <p><span class="lbl lbl-result">Result</span>
        I created all the diagrams used for planning that were presented to the business owner.
      </p>

      <ul class="key-points">
        <li><strong>Virtual Infrastructure Plan</strong> included all of the existing hardware and storage and the most efficient way I found to consolidate everything.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage Plan</strong> includes the existing storage volumes and how I was going to organize them.</li>
        <li><strong>Server Licensing</strong> broke down the existing licensing (uncompliant) and the new licensing requirement for Windows Server 2022.</li>
        <li><strong>Final Diagram</strong> is the final result. We were able to execute this plan with one late night onsite visit and zero downtime for the customer.</li>

      <h2>Project Two — Infrastructure Optimization and Failover Setup</h2>

      <p><span class="lbl lbl-problem">Problem</span>
        This new customer was not fully utilizing their server infrastructure to reduce costs and improve workflow efficiency. They also had previously purchased a failover server for a stretch cluster that was never deployed.
      </p>

      <p><span class="lbl lbl-solution">Solution</span>
        Migrate from using JumpCloud logins to unifying their workstations with a site-to-site VPN to ensure AD domain access. Then move their data and workloads to the existing RDS infrastructure. Followed by locking local PCs down with group policies and basic images. Finally, configure stretch failover cluster between two sites.
      </p>

      <p><span class="lbl lbl-result">Result</span>
        An efficient AD environment with a stretch failover cluster for disaster recovery.
      </p>

      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>I created the plans that were presented to the stakeholders and worked with onsite IT personnel to execute on the changes for unifying the domain.</li>
        <li>I identified the existing server environment and how to fit it within a smaller physical server in another city. I came up with the plan and executed deployment of server including onsite install.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Project Three — Smaller Server Optimization</h2>

      <p><span class="lbl lbl-problem">Problem</span>
        Our MSP inherited this customer who had a server that was underperforming.
      </p>

      <p><span class="lbl lbl-solution">Solution</span>
        Optimize existing infrastructure to boost performance 4×.
      </p>

      <p><span class="lbl lbl-result">Result</span>
        I investigated the server and found everything that would immediately lead to a performance increase if corrected. I executed on all of those things and informed the satisfied customer what all was done in the stakeholder update.

      <h2>Project Four — Moving infrastructure Onsite</h2>

      <p><span class="lbl lbl-problem">Problem</span>
        Our customer was outgrowing our multi-tenant RDS Cloud Desktop product.
      </p>

      <p><span class="lbl lbl-solution">Solution</span>
        Move to onsite infrastructure while keeping all data intact and zero downtime.
      </p>

      <p><span class="lbl lbl-result">Result</span>
        I created the diagram that was presented to the owners to secure the project. I came up with all of the plans and directed our employee to do all onsite setup and configuration. I successfully moved a SQL database from our datacenter to their server and ensured all data remained intact with zero downtime.
